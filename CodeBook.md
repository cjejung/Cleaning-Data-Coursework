## Code Book
# Introduction
This codebook describes the dataset called `tidyset` obteined when running the `run_analysis.R` code.
The code was created as part of the coursework for the Coursera 'Getting & Cleaning Data' course.

# Key facts
The dataset `tidyset` contains 180 rows and 68 columns.

# Description of the variables

*subject* - identifies the subject who performed the activities. Its range is from 1 to 30.
*activity* - identifies the activity performed by the subject for which the measurements have been taken. activity can be one of: WALKING, WALKING-UPSTAIRS, WALKING-DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING or LAYING

The remaining variables contain the average of the mean and standard deviation of each of the measurements taken during the experiments.
